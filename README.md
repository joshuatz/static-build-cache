# Static-Build-Cache
![NodeJS CI Passing Status Badge](https://github.com/joshuatz/static-build-cache/workflows/Node.js%20CI/badge.svg)

> This is a tool meant to help avoid redundant builds for projects that use a typical "build and serve" pipeline for static content. E.g. projects that use React without a backend, Gatsby, docs, etc.

This tool was originally created to speed up the serve process on a Create-React-App based project on Glitch. The typical "build and serve" approach, using `package.json` scripts, might look like:

```sh
npm run build && npm run serve
```

...but there is a big issue with the above workflow. It compiles / creates a fresh build, *every*, *single*, *time*. When your build system has access to git and *should* know if things have actually changed, does this make sense to do? Not to me.

So I created this. Instead of calling `build && serve`, you call this tool, and it will check if a fresh build is necessary based on the last git commit. If so, it will run your build command before serving, otherwise go straight to serving.

## Side-note
A tool similar to this one *probably* exists somewhere out there already. Regardless, this was a fun learning experience for me, and fits my needs.

## Installation
@TODO: Publish on NPM and provide link

## Usage

You can either call this via the CLI (exposed through `.bin` as `static-build-cache`), or via standard JS modules.

> A large goal of this tool is to provide as much of a config-free experience as possible. For many static apps, you can use it without passing *any* options at all! âœ¨

Options:

Full (CLI + JS) | Short | Default | Description
--- | --- | --- | ---
`--projectRoot` | `-d` | `.` / caller dir | Project root directory (where `package.json` can be found)
`--buildDir` | `-o` | `./build` | Where build files are emitted
`--buildCmd` | `-b` | Depends. Tries to detect from your `package.json` automatically, and/or framework. | What command to execute to produce a build
`--serveCmd` | `-s` | Depends. Tries to detect from your `package.json`. Falls back to bundled server ([`local-web-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/local-web-server)). | What command to use to serve `./build`.
`--useGit` | `-g` | `true` | Use git to decide whether or not a fresh build is necessary. This is 99% of why this tool is useful, so does not make much sense to have as `false`.
`--cacheFileName` | NA | `.static-build-cache-meta` | Filename to use for the file which will record build info
`--silent` | `-s` | `false` | Suppress stdout messages. If you disable it, you might miss info about serving...
`--verbose` | `-v` | `false` | Turn on *extra* logging.
`--servePort` | `-p` | `3000` | If using the built-in server, which port to serve on.

> For the config passed to `main()`, the same option keys are used as the CLI options, just without the `--`. 

### Usage Example
Package.json / CLI:

```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"build-and-serve": "static-build-cache"
	}
}
```

More advanced:
```json
{
	"scripts": {
		"my-serve": "... (something complicated)",
		"build-and-serve": "static-build-cache --serveCmd \"npm run my-serve\" -p 3001"
	}
}
```

ESM Module, with Async / Await:

```js
import {main} from 'static-build-cache';

const RUN_TIME_MINS = 2;

const limitedRun = async () => {
	const runner = await main({
		servePort: 3002
	});

	// Do something
	console.log(`Browse my site at http://localhost:3002. For only the next ${RUN_TIME_MINS} minutes!`);

	setTimeout(async () => {
		await runner.forceExit();
		console.log(`Server has been shut down!`);
	}, RUN_TIME_MINS * 1000 * 60);
};

limitedRun();
```


## Development
Most of the development environment is pretty standard. However, one important thing to note is that I'm not transpiling my tests (in TypeScript) to JS in advance; instead I'm using `ts-node` to transpile them (as-needed) when `ava` is called.

> I *highly* recommend using [yalc](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yalc) for local testing while developing. I left some yalc specific commands in my `package.scripts` section, which are helpful if you have it installed.
